    <p align="center" ; style="color:green"> <b> BIRTH: October 15, 1931 <br> Rameswaram,India </p>

    <p style="color:maroon" ; "font-decoration:underline" ;> <u> Indian scientist and politician who played a leading
            role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002
            to 2007 </u> </p>

    </p>
    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the
    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation,
    where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced
    in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
    helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
    ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
    <p style="color:maroon">From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served
        as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent
        role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
        national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward
        a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a
        less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing
        agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to
        health care and education.

    <p style="color:blue">In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed
        outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even
        though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the
        Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy.

    </p>

    <p style="color:maroon">Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely
        ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha
        Patil, the country’s first woman president.

        Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India
        into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while
        delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest
        soon afterward.

    <p style="color:blue">In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
        Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
        made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved
        to be successful.

    <p style="color:maroon"> Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
        presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His
        term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
        would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
        Congress Party backed his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam,
        Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement
        of his candidature:

    <p style="color:blue">The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
        assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
        conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an
        easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the
        third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before
        becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of
        Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India. </p>


    <p style="color:maroon"> Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were
        conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as
        the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.Media
        coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the
        director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised
        Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.</p>


    <p style="color:blue"> His also steered plan to provide cheap and clean drinking water and helped a few Pune-based
        designers develop a sub-Rs 1,000 water purifier, Swach. Design Directions Private Limited took more than three
        years to make this 560-mm unit for purifying water.

    <p style="color:maroon">At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a
        second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[65]
        However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to
        avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[66] He was proposed by third front named United
        National Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam
        Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA
        constituents, to receive a renewed mandat</p>
